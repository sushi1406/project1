# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Welcome to my Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This repository contains all the code and resources for cleaning a dataset and performing EDA using SQL.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using SQL. By working on this project, I aim to enhance my ability to preprocess raw data and extract meaningful insights from it.

## Introduction

Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves removing or fixing errors and inconsistencies in the data to ensure its quality. Once the data is cleaned, exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps in understanding the data better and uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships.

In this project, I used SQL to perform data cleaning and EDA on a dataset. The SQL scripts and queries used in this project are included in this repository.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Layoffs 2022['https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022'] dataset from Kaggle. It contains information on layoffs that occurred in 2020-2023, including company names, locations, industry types, number of employees laid off, and more.

##Tools
- MySql

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves the following steps:

1. REMOVE DUPLICATES
2. STANDARDIZE THE DATA
3. NULL VALUES OR BLANK VALUES
4. REMOVE ANY COLUMN 

The SQL scripts used for data cleaning can be found in the `data_cleaning.sql` file.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis helps in understanding the data better. The following EDA techniques were performed:

1. General Overview
2. Maximum Layoffs
3. Companies with 100% Layoffs
4. Layoffs Per Company
5. Layoff Timeline
6. Industry Analysis
7. Country Analysis
8. Yearly Layoffs
9. Layoffs by Stage
10. Monthly Layoffs
11. Rolling Total Layoffs
12. Company Layoffs by Year
13. Top Companies by Layoffs Each Year
    
The SQL queries used for EDA can be found in the `eda.sql` file.

## Results

The key findings from the EDA include:

- [Maximum layoffs and percentage of layoffs among the companies.]
- [Analysis of companies with 100% layoffs and their financial background.]
- [Total layoffs by company, industry, country, and stage.]
- [Timeline of layoffs from start to end.]
- [Yearly and monthly trends in layoffs.]
- [Top companies by layoffs each year.]
